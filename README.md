1. 
Implement and demonstratethe FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on a given set of training data samples. Read the training data fromat.CSV file.

2. 
For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

3. 
Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm.
Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledgetoclassify a new sample

4. 
Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithmand test the same using appropriate data sets

5. 
Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training dataset stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test
data sets.

6.
Write a program to construct aBayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using standard Heart DiseaseData Set. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.

7. 
Apply EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a .CSV file. Use the same dataset for clustering using k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these twoalgorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python MLlibrary classes/API in the program

an K mean clustering data example.
