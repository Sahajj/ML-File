 1. Implement and demonstrate the FIND-S algorithm for finding the most specific hypothesis based on training data samples. Read the training data fromat.CSV file. 

2. For a given set of training data examples stored in a . CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.

3. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree-based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.

4. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets 

5. Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training dataset stored as a . CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering a few test data sets.

6. Write a program to construct a Bayesian network considering medical data. Use this model to demonstrate the diagnosis of heart patients using the standard Heart DiseaseData Set. You can use Java/Python ML library classes/API.

7. Apply the EM algorithm to cluster a set of data stored in a . CSV file. Use the same dataset for clustering using the k-Means algorithm. Compare the results of these two algorithms and comment on the quality of clustering. You can add Java/Python ML library classes/API to the program.
